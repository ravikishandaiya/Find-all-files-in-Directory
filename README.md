 By modifying a bit we can archive all following, (i didn't make these changes to prevent your loss of import files)
 1. We can find all files of specific size and specific extension.
 2. we can move or copy files with the same extension in a single directory.
 3. we can run the program to delete the file of a specific size or specific extension.
 4. we can get a list of all protected files and folders in the directory.
 5. we can rename a lot of files according to us.
 And many more things, simply we can automate many things in windows which we could ever think.
 If you are interested to explore os library then take a look.
# Environment
 1. It's a python3 script file, so to run the script you will need python3 on your system.
 2. I used OS library according to windows so it will run perfectly on windows, to run on Linux or Mac you have to make some changes.
# How to use
 Just run the python script file.
